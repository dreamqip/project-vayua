# Vayua Wizard

Welcome to Vayua Wizard! This tool empowers content creators, streamers, and bloggers to easily create DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations) without the need for complex smart contract development. Vayua Wizard simplifies the process of creating and deploying governance token contracts and governance contracts, allowing you to focus on building and managing your community.

### **Introduction**

Vayua Wizard is designed to simplify the process of creating a DAO by providing an intuitive interface for configuring and deploying governance token contracts and governance contracts. With Vayua Wizard, you can easily set up the governance parameters for your community and empower your audience to participate in decision-making.

### **Getting Started**

### Prerequisites

In order to use Vayua Wizard for creating your own DAO, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Your wallet is connected to the Vayua Platform. We recommend using MetaMask, but WalletConnect and Coinbase Wallet are also available!
- Ensure you have a sufficient amount of Theta tokens (THETA) in your wallet. Theta tokens would be needed for deploying your DAO contracts to the Theta Network. If you donâ€™t have enough tokens, you can obtain THETA through exchanges or other means supported by the Theta network.
- You do not need to know or understand any programming language or blockchain development tools to create your DAOs with Vayua Wizard within a minute, but familiarity with governance contracts and their configuration is essential to effectively use Vayua Wizard. Understanding concepts such as governance token, governor contracts, proposal deadlines, thresholds, voting delays, and quorum requirements will enable you to configure your DAO according to your desired specifications. It is recommended to have a basic understanding of smart contracts and governance mechanisms before using Vayua Wizard.

By fulfilling these prerequisites, you will be well-prepared to use Vayua Wizard effectively and create DAOs on Vayua Platform.

### Creating a DAO

To create a DAO using Vayua Wizard, follow the step-by-step guide below.

### **Step-by-Step Guide**

Clearly check short instructions of what is Vayua Wizard about. Then click "Next step" to proceed to the next step.

### Step 1: Configure Governance Token and Governance Contract

In the "Token Configuration" section, specify the parameters for your governance token contract. It is important to carefully configure Governance token since it defines the specific parameters and characteristics of your DAO's governance. The governance token serves as a key element in decentralized governance, granting holders voting power within the DAO ecosystem.

### Governance token configuration

- Choose the token type between NFT standard or ERC20 token.
- Provide the token name and symbol.
- Fill in additional fields based on the chosen token type.
- After filling in the form, a dropdown window will display the generated token smart contract code.

### Governance contract configuration

- Configure the Governance contract by fulfilling the required parameters:
  - Name: Provide a name for the governance contract.
  - Voting Delay: Set the time delay before voting on proposals can begin.
  - Voting Period: Define the duration of the voting period for each proposal.
  - Proposal Threshold: Set the minimum voting threshold required for a proposal to pass.
  - Quorum: Define the minimum percentage of voting participation required for a valid vote.
- Similar to the governance token configuration, a dropdown window will display the generated contract code for the governance contract.

### Step 2: Deploy DAO

In the second step, user deploys the configured contracts into the Theta chain. Make sure your wallet is connected before proceeding.Click the "Deploy Contracts" button.

- Click the "Deploy Contracts" button.
- The token contract is compiled, and if successful, it is deployed.
- Sign a transaction to deploy the token contract, as it incurs THETA token costs.
- After deploying the token contract, the process continues with the deployment of the governance contract.
- Similarly, governance contract will be compiled and then deployed. Remember to sign a transaction to deploy the governance contract.

### Step 3: Obtain Contract Addresses and Safely Store Them

In the final step, users receive the contract addresses of their deployed DAO. It is crucial to securely store these addresses for future reference and interaction with the DAO.

Congratulations! You have successfully deployed your DAO using Vayua Wizard.

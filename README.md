## Inspiration

Vayua DAO is a platform designed to provide an intuitive tool for creating DAOs, where users can easily create and manage DAOs, and actively participate in voting. We have built a space where users can participate in the Vayua Metaverse by creating personal profiles and making key DAO decisions as accessible as interacting with the DAO itself.

- Content creators can establish their own DAO, allowing followers to propose and vote on content ideas.
- Digital artists can form a DAO to host virtual galleries, enabling fans to buy and sell digital art.
- Entrepreneurs can leverage DAOs for decentralized crowdfunding, where investors make decisions.
- Non-profit organizations can create DAOs to ensure transparent and democratic fund allocation.
- Game developers can create DAOs where gamers can influence game development decisions.

## What it does

Vayua DAO is a comprehensive platform designed to revolutionize the interaction with DAOs and facilitate the creation of a vibrant Metaverse:

Vayua Metaverse:** At the heart of our project is the creation of a dynamic Metaverse where users build their profiles and interact with various DAOs. As more users join and interact, they contribute to the evolution and expansion of the Metaverse, creating an ecosystem that is vibrant, inclusive, and ever-changing.

**Vayua Identity:** This feature allows users and DAOs to create unique profiles. For individual users, it provides a way to present themselves within the Metaverse. In that way, they enhance trust and reliability as proposers or delegatees in the eyes of other members. Furthermore, DAOs can create profiles highlighting their mission, name of DAO, Bio, Avatar, Location, Website URL, and social media links and attract like-minded individuals to join their cause.

**Vayua Wizard: Vayua Wizard is an intuitive tool designed to simplify the process of DAO creation. It streamlines the process into a few easy steps and forms so that users can create their own DAO by effortlessly establishing smart contracts (token and governance).

Vayua Extensions:** These are modular components that are added to enhance the functionality of the Vayua DAO. Currently, we offer a 'Starring extension' feature, allowing users to bookmark their favorite DAOs or any DAOs they wish to monitor closely.

**Vayua Marketplace:** We plan to establish a marketplace that facilitates extension trading and purchases, creating a thriving economic system within the Metaverse. Users will be able to buy, sell, and trade digital assets, enhancing the economic vibrancy of the DAO environment.

## **How we built it

Building the Vayua Platform was an adventure in innovation. It all started with exploring the market. We came up with the idea of combining the big, digital world of the Metaverse with the group decision-making power of DAOs. This inspiration led to the creation of the Vayua Platform, our project's backbone.

The next step was creating the Vayua Identity, a way for users to have a unique digital presence. This was central to the Metaverse experience we were crafting. We focused on making it easy for users to create and personalize their profiles so every interaction felt genuine.

Next, we made DAOs accessible to everyone, even those new to the concept. The result was the Vayua Wizard, a tool that simplified the creation of a DAO with just a few clicks. It was all about empowering users, no matter their technical background.

We also added unique features to our Vayua DAO, like Extensions. For example, the Starring Extension allows users to bookmark their favorite DAOs and keep them accessible. This way, users can easily stay connected to their bookmarked DAOs' activities.

## Challenges we ran into

The challenge we faced involved dealing with OpenZeppelin's Governor standard. While it's widely recognized, the Governor standard has inherent drawbacks that complicate its implementation in our project. One significant issue was the need for more public access to proposal records. This obfuscation forced us to use parsing logs to obtain a list of proposals for a given DAO, an inefficient and counterintuitive process. In our view, this lack of transparency and accessibility is a considerable oversight, and its tight coupling with the Compound Governor standard means it has inherited its strengths and weaknesses.

While developing Vayua Platform 1.0.1, we faced many bugs and low-quality code. After exhaustive testing and community feedback, we enhanced our code, fixed minor bugs, and presented the improved Vayua Platform 1.0.2.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We are proud to have created a unique product - Vayua DAO. Our significant achievement is the Vayua Platform, designed to simplify DAO interactions. Also, we've developed the Vayua Identity, enhancing user engagement in the Metaverse, and Vayua Wizard, making DAO setup more accessible. Lastly, our commitment to OpenZeppelin's Governor standard exemplifies our dedication to secure, decentralized practices.

## What we learned

Through the journey of developing Vayua DAO, we amassed significant learnings which have significantly shaped our approach:

- Adaptability: Navigating the DAO and Metaverse landscapes required frequent adjustments and refinements to our strategies. We adapted to complexities, particularly with standards such as OpenZeppelin's Governor.
- Time Management: Balancing various aspects of the project under tight deadlines taught us the essence of effective planning, prioritization, and resource allocation. We learned to devote adequate time and resources to each component to ensure their successful development.
- Teamwork: Our journey reinforced the importance of leveraging individual strengths within our team and working towards a shared vision. Our success in creating a functional platform that is set to transform DAO interaction is a testament to our collective efforts and effective collaboration.
